* **L110F Bellhousing lockout plate.step** - This is the plate that mounts to the front of the bellhousing and provides a location to weld a lockout shaft.  This model was created by @jrbe from a 3D scan provided by Thomas Moland.
* **oil pump adapter.step** - This is an adapter flange that removes the L110F/L110 electric oil pump and adapts it to 1/4" NPT fittings for running to an external oil pump.  Made by scanning the oil pump and creating a sketch.  It uses #114 O-rings.
* **HF2A-L110F Adapter.step** - This is an adapter plate to allow mounting an HF2A (HF2AV and HF1A as well theoretically) to the back of the L110F transmission.  The first version of this file is the version which was cut out using an ArcDroid CNC Plasma; then holes reamed out, minor adjustments made, and used on my truck.  The latest version here has some of those adjustments made to the model but has not been cut out to steel yet.
